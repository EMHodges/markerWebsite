                    <mat-card-content>
                        Your answer to each question, the marks awarded and the results of the test cases will be collected.   
                        This data will only be collected when you upload the file containing your answers (generated
                        by the marker) to this website.

                        When submitting the file there is also a questionnaire that I kindly ask you to fill in.

                    <mat-card-subtitle>How will my data be anonymized?</mat-card-subtitle>
                    <mat-card-content>
                        The name of the generated file containing your answers consits of a unique and randomized 6 digit number which will be used to
                        identify your answers. Remember the name of this file since it will be needed to request for 
                        your data to be withdrawn as it is the only way to identify your submission.
                                                
                        At no point will any information that could be used to identify you such as: e-mail, name, date of birth etc. be collected.

                    <mat-card-subtitle>How will my data be stored?</mat-card-subtitle>
                    <mat-card-content>
                        When downloading the python marker you will be assigned a unique 6 digit ID which will be stored in a private Google Sheet as a sign of your consent
                        to participating in the experiment.

                        The file containing your anonymous answers and answers to the questionnaire will be submitted and stored via <a href='https://formfacade.com/enhance/'>FormFacade</a>.
