                Thank you for your interest in participating in this project. Please read the following information carefully.
                        
            <mat-card-subtitle>Purpose of the research</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                The research project is to design an automated Python marker. The Python marker should work offline, be easy to use and able to mark composite questions 
                (i.e. a question that consists of multiple parts, part I, part II etc.). Collecting data on how the marker awarded marks and whether the marker was usable 
                will help me know if I’ve met my project’s aims.
            </mat-card-content>   
            <mat-card-content>
                The study is being conducted as an undergraduate project for Computer Science

            <mat-card-subtitle>Your participation</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>You need to be over the age of 18.</mat-card-content>
            <mat-card-content>
                Participation is completely voluntary and you are free to withdraw your data at any point upto, and including, 10.04.22 without any negative consequences. 
                Details on how to do so is in the ‘withdrawing consent’ section below.
            </mat-card-content> 
            <mat-card-content>
                You will not be compensated for your participation, but your participation is very much appreciated.
            </mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-subtitle>What will I need to do?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                You’ll need to download the python marker and run it locally on your machine. There will be a series of programming questions to attempt. Once finished you will 
                be need to download a file containing your answers (the python marker will generate this file for you) and upload it to this website. There is also a 
                questionnaire to fill in.
            </mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-subtitle>What data will be collected?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                While answering questions you will be able to test your code and submit your answers as many times as you like. Each time you test your code or submit an answer 
                your answer, marks awarded and generated feedback will be recorded. Note this data will only be used in the study and can only be seen by the researchers once the 
                file generated by the automated python marker is uploaded to the website. You will be able to see the data collected by opening the file generated by the python marker.  
            </mat-card-content>
            <mat-card-content>
                If you fill in the questionnaire your answers to these will also be collected. The questionnaire asks questions about the usability of the automated python marker and 
                will not ask for any personal or identifying data.
            </mat-card-content>    
            <mat-card-content>All the data will be anonymized.</mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-subtitle>How will my data be anonymized?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                The name of the generated file containing your answers consist of a unique and randomized 6-digit number. All data supplied 
                (confirmation of informed consent, file generated by the python marker and questionnaire answers) will be identified by this 6-digit number only. 
                At no point will any personal or identifying information be asked for or recorded.
                Remember the name of this file since it will be needed to request for your data to be withdrawn as it is the only way to identify your submission.                     
            </mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-subtitle>How will my data be stored?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                Your unique 6-digit id number, file generated by the automated marker and questionnaire answers will be stored in my university Google Drive. 
            </mat-card-content>
            <mat-card-content>
                The University’s cloud storage solution is provided by Google, which means that data can be located at any of Google’s globally spread data centres. 
                The University has data protection compliant arrangements in place with this provider (see https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/google/policy/privacy/). 
                The University processes personal data for research purposes under Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data will 
                be kept until the final marks are formally approved for the module.

            <mat-card-content> 
                If you have concerns about how your information is being processed, please contact the University’s Data Protection Officer at dataprotection@york.ac.uk. 
                If you are concerned about the way in which the University has handled your personal data, you have a right to lodge a complaint to the Information 
                Commissioner’s Office (Tel: 0303 123 1113, see www.ico.org.uk/concerns for more information).     
            </mat-card-content>

            <mat-card-subtitle>Who will see my answers?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                As the primary researchers of this project myself (Elizabeth Hodges) and my supervisor Lilian Blot will see your anonymized answers. Your anonymous answers 
                may also be shared with other researchers at the University of York. If the data is published it will be completely anonymous and unidentifiable.
            </mat-card-content>   

            <mat-card-subtitle>How can I be sure downloading the marker is safe?</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-content>
                The automated python marker is an exe file. The exe file is only available to download on this website once it has been scanned by Microsoft Defender with no 
                threats being found.
