# MarkerWebsite

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Deploying the exe
If you pull the code from github and then deploy directly the pythonMarker.exe file will be a git LSFO pointer instead of the executable file.

To prevent this either download the pythonMarker exe from the github repository directly, manually copy it into the assets folder and rename it to pythonMarker.exe then deploy the build.

Or build the python marker locally and copy the exe from the dist folder to the assets folder and then deploy.

## Deploying to gh pages
Run the command ```ng deploy --base-href==/markerWebsite/```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
